How to start the application?

1) Restore the scripts with "npm install react-scripts --save"
2) Start the api with "npm run server" (The server is configured for port 3000)
3) In another terminal start the application with "npm start" (Node js will ask for confirmation for using port 3001. Confirm with 'y')
